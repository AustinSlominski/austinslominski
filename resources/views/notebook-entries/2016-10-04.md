So I guess this is the first entry into this notebook. I've been keeping notes in this way for a while now but with this it'll be a lot easier to add and remove information from certain entries.

I've been thinking a lot about how permanent study is, or really just how little I seem to remember when I jump in and out of certain projects. Like while setting up the notebook page, I was sitting there wondering whether or not I wanted to make a full system out of it. I guess that would be fine, but I'd rather just get up and going with it, I'm not in the mood for much web work right now.

I'm in between a few projects, most of them mainly dealing with openFrameworks and Kinect, but also looking to get into some SuperCollider stuff, just because it's always interested me. I am better with Max though, which makes me think it's a waste of time to just learn a new language. Every year I look back and think about the fact that I have no longer videos, no longer sound pieces, I spend a lot of time learning different things, and relearning them.
