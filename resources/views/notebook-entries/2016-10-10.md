Today I had a chance to mess around with some simple colorizing and anaglyph stuff, enjoying that way that some of that looks.

It's nothing much but since I've been out of Photoshop any time I spend with GIMP is worth it to even just get the hotkeys down again.

Worked on my variable-rate looper in Max as well, hoping I can incorporate it into plenty of other sound projects. Working on smoothing out the sound, making sure it's accurate, and just making it overall more flexible. I need kind of an insert version and an instrument version.

A little slip up in productivity for the last few days, but I've been glad to get a new focus on sound right now.
