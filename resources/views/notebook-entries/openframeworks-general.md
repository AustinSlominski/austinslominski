## General openFrameworks

openFrameworks is an open source C++ toolkit. If you've used Processing in the past or something, it's similar to that. I end up thinking of it as a more buff Processing based in C++ instead of Java. openFrameworks is a great place to create interactive installation pieces, find clever way of messing with video or data, etc. It's also what I prefer for testing GLSL shaders.
