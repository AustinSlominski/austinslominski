## No code explanations

When I learn new things I really enjoy trying to find the explanations that don't involve jargon. Last night I was explaining how I was sonifying some video stuff through Max. It's easiest to just point at a computer or tv screen and say "this is a matrix, and it's a huge grid that holds numbers". I want to try to do more "no-code" tutorials, that hopefully are abstracted enough that they can be helpful to anyone, regardless of medium.
