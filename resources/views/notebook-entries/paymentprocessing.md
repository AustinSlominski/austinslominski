## Payment Processing

Some examples:

[Authorize.net][1]
[Stripe][2]

[1]: authorize.net
[2]: stripe.com

It appears that all of the payment processing services have a 2.9%+$0.30 transaction fee, but that's specifically if they aren't currently using a merchant account. Otherwise, you can connect the merchant account to authorize.net.
