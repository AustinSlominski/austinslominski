## Granular Synthesis

Granular synthesis is a method of synthesizing sound using small "particles" of sound. These sounds are short enough to exist on the boundary of where we can discern duration, frequency, and amplitude discrimination. Iannis Xenakis was the first composer to establish it as a compositional device, or otherwise devise a theory of it.
